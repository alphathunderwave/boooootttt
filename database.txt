But I think the cops need to protect themselves first and foremost @Pschlarm but it proves that he is capable of some serious violence @Pschlarm because the cops aren't sex offenders with criminal records @Pschlarm the cops dilemma. I don't think those cops suit up everyday and think  "I'm gonna kill a black guy" @Pschlarm if the cops were struggling to keep him down and they thought it's either us or him then while it may not be justified one can see @Pschlarm because regardless of his social life he could very well be a criminal. @Pschlarm that is really irritating because, a) one of the statements was false, obviously, and b) his children have nothing to do with this @Pschlarm I'm not going to disagree with you, that man shouldn't be dead. But when people say "unarmed black man" and "he was a father"... @Pschlarm well not to defend the killing, just remain open minded. @HistoryToLearn communist... so a buffoon... 😂😂😂 https://t.co/MbtRApSbzB @Pschlarm eye witness accounts also said "hands up, don't shoot."

Bury them forever Praying that Toronto is like that Colorado team that had one good year and is now an abomination of the sport It literally looks like batting practice https://t.co/eMqHFNZ34p Still can't believe Wisconsin blew that game last night @Things4WhitePpl while wearing volleyball knee pads Yo Wisconsin how do you let that happen @EmilyWartinger @AngeliaKowalski she ain sleep My man missed the question mark https://t.co/aLB4ykXSjC Think less.

A lot of gray area Heh https://t.co/jS5tKOgdAk @CodyBreedlove32 @Krauseyboy dude got FLATTENED lol @Krauseyboy That's fair enough. My point is that he didn't break any rules with that hit. Only interference @Krauseyboy you're absolutely right but if you're gonna suspend a guy for hitting someone too hard, you have to put it in the rules @CodyBreedlove32 @Krauseyboy I wouldn't call it clean. It's 150% interference and he definitely should've sat for 2 @Krauseyboy so he got suspended because someone else broke up a pass. You suspend the hit, not the situation @Krauseyboy if the pass gets to him is it clean @Krauseyboy idk dude there's no way you convince me that should be a suspension. You can't suspend guys for being big and strong @Krauseyboy yea interference. Not a 3 game suspension The worst part is now he has a suspension history so you know they'll sit him down for 10 games next chance they get 1) No contact with the head
2) Never left his feet

You're a college professor, sound it out. Ummmmmmm https://t.co/TxSfVS1xzY @jackdigiac @amazon who is your calendar guy I need to have a word Ordered a book and chose the 5-8 day shipping window.

SPEAK UP CHRISTINE Toronto's rebuild started after ours https://t.co/Ytwfhf6GIo @BuffaloSabres You were up two. Win a game It's the coach. There's no excuse for this I love Marcus Foligno, just not on a line with 23 and 15 Complete collapse. Maybe next year @J2theGrr this might be funny if you used the name of someone actually on the sabres broadcast A couple errant passes and bouncing pucks have this team all out of sorts. Need to refocus Remember the 2-0 lead? Good times @EmilyWartinger changed our lives @MorlikTheDwarf I know where my priorities stand @becstasy_ your program ensures a body guard that gets in progressively worse shape and is less able to protect you. That said, I'll take it @becstasy_ what's the pay Very nervous to start classes again but mostly because I have done literally zero preparation My semester doesn't start till 1:00 I already feel behind @MorlikTheDwarf so I have to go out and  buy all the yogurt myself?

Either call the rulebook or change it https://t.co/z2iheJkIMo That's 100% an illegal hit but it's not called because it's a punyer. That is an instant flag minus the shock value @J2theGrr hockey is better Speed limits are such a buzzkill @Duke_University not often @Duke_University True. They didn't. But that doesn't mean they weren't really good last year @Duke_University he was still good then, able to carry a team.

They get cute with the play calling now You put the ball in Reggie Bush's hands... I just don't understand I had a lot of predictions for today. None of them involved this being a good football game Tyrod bolts out of a clean pocket.

Wow only 2 days till festivus I can't believe it As much as he is at fault for his poor performance, the sabres have scored a total of zero times for Robin Lehner in the shootout this year Shootouts are STUPID Lol every shootout ends exactly the same @Molly_PC I'm impressed Every single time I'm asked "how ya doin" I respond by repeating the same words in the exact same tone and cadence I have zero social skills @louloukay22 thx @ShaneCooke_ finally gave it a listen You'll have more than one peak The romance between Barstool and Bills fans is touching https://t.co/6esnQwYJPY Must be nice https://t.co/2zNpUKmjRi Can somebody please explain how on earth this is a penalty?

Blessed! 🙏🙏 @apush_review @J2theGrr names it the lake Erie sadness bowl every year and I think that's an apt description @J2theGrr It's honestly not bad. $10/hr with lunch and dinner included. They probably have a room full of extra tickets so why not add that The Bills are offering free tickets if you go and shovel the stadium. Or you can just spend $6 @nhl call the rulebook @Molly_PC honestly same I thought we could be the generation to drive that poison out of business @ShaneCooke_ in haven't even considered starting Eichel's behind the back breakout pass 😍 So effortless. So many guys would take that behind their own net and get in trouble @ShaneCooke_ we're all losers Swedish Fish are... @Molly_PC @AngeliaKowalski she's the reason I added the second condition @gaseous_weave wow v true I didn't even think of that @gaseous_weave boat at the beach Used to be that only celebrities and really funny tweets got 10k+ rts, now it's mostly people intentionally butchering the English language I can watch the sabres game tonight totally uninterrupted and without any subconscious self-loathing about all the school work I'm ignoring 😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/qbR5uOyaOG @amp913 oh my God I thought no one would ever ask Top 5 scene in TV history don't @ me https://t.co/XnmbGkRXTM "I'm starting this assignment after this song"

I've given in @EmilyWartinger @donz2210 and I you I love this man https://t.co/q9tGc9J2E6 @EmilyWartinger @realjuicyb @donz2210 That is what we'll learn soon I guess. It's up to him to recognize that and stop it @CassidiY @bnfvd lol the majority of everyone's voters are white @samashleyyy ❤ @becstasy_ @realjuicyb @donz2210 I've seen 50+ tweets/rts that say exactly that in the past 2 days. I'm sorry if I've jumbled the sources @becstasy_ @realjuicyb @donz2210 because I'm fighting the same battles every single time I do this. @realjuicyb @donz2210 @becstasy_ I guess I have no morals. I'm sorry for being such a hateful person. I hope I never hurt your feelings @realjuicyb @donz2210 @becstasy_ There it is. The good old liberal defense mechanism. Accuse accuse accuse. I'm sorry, I forgot u were right @samashleyyy I appreciate that @donz2210 @becstasy_ @realjuicyb the media fabrication that Trump is the face of all of those things is what triggered their actions Tee-Nyce This dude has the strangest twitter I love it https://t.co/nfIqZ942jz @J2theGrr draining 3's Also Mike Condon isn't terribly great Sam Reinhart is an absolute monster @ShaneCooke_ @J2theGrr maybe ur schizophrenic @ShaneCooke_ I voted romo https://t.co/miFGL3lndo Dude I damn near just recited the whole thing first try https://t.co/RXPBeuzrsf I'm exhausted by this. Done thinking about this election @realjuicyb @thatgingerkid23 I'm not telling you to accept those things as you see them. I'm just asking why more hatred is the answer @realjuicyb @thatgingerkid23 I'm sorry that so many people think he's a real threat @realjuicyb I don't hate you, I don't know really anyone who does hate you, and I genuinely don't believe Donald Trump hates you @realjuicyb And I hope I don't appear to pretend to understand the lives of those who aren't. But I can assure anyone who is afraid @realjuicyb I guess the problem is that I never interpreted it that way. @realjuicyb I get what you're saying. I understand that people interpreted his campaign as one based on hatred. @realjuicyb I mean dude, we had this discussion last night. Clearly you don't understand what I'm saying. So what is the point "We are a nation divided"

Said by the very people driving the conflict and accusing half the nation of being racist To people spreading hate toward Trump and his supporters: what is your endgame? What do you hope to accomplish by digging this trench? @realjuicyb Crazy, I thought i just spent 15 minutes explaining why those flaws are misconceptions. In any case, goodnight @realjuicyb what part of my message here is me hiding from what he is? @realjuicyb Why do you think I don't feel responsible for my vote? Because I'm not basking in his victory and gloating like an ass? @realjuicyb https://t.co/YxqSCmZ1dH @realjuicyb it is not denying based on religion! It is a TEMPORARY suspension of immigration from a specific GEOGRAPHICAL area @realjuicyb https://t.co/LGKcljnQID @realjuicyb why is he racist @realjuicyb It's a response to being inundated with all the reasons I am all those things. I can't express enough why it's hypocritical T H I S https://t.co/s92iO3BHUw If you think the Great Depression happened in ONE year and because of Republicans... oh boy https://t.co/WFEVsEBC4j Wow a candidates supporters are hurt that their candidate didn't do so hot. This is definitely hard-hitting, probab… https://t.co/kWvQy1OZdE A question for ppl who actually care about celebrity political views: Why? All white people are racist!! You heard it here!! Didn't know it but I guess I hate all minorities!!!! https://t.co/6Jjnoi03Wl "Like, that's a lot of votes for a dead gorilla!!" Twitter is such a strange microcosm. How is it that I see only fear regarding these results but... they're the results Prediction: Jill Stein becomes the 45th President Not at all what I was expecting wow https://t.co/wW3vsPJO9L @jackdigiac an* wow I am off my game "Two female Trump protestors were arrested for taking their tops off in a elementary school gymnasium"

..............why.............. My election angst is mixing with my Bills frustration and it is creating one nasty cocktail let me tell you @ShannonRaczka you better tolerate everyone and everything but if you disagree with them you're intolerable and a rotten person Wow liberals have all the answers they must be so smart https://t.co/xNkKqzHuSe My predictions:

August- no way Hillary wins

September &amp; October- Trump is done for

November 8th- no freaking clue @Duke_University @martybiron43 @WGR550 what is he saying I can't listen @realjuicyb once or twice yes About to walk into my polling place with a sign that says "This is my first time please help me" The problem with using outrageously colorful language ALL the time is that there is no way to elevate it. I can't express anger any stronger After this mockery, we get to experience election day. The hits just keep on coming folks @RSherman_25 You sir, are a rotten human being. I wish you nothing but misfortune Nah, that's bullshit. Sherman can rot in hell https://t.co/EOAwdFq5ZT The ref standing 10 feet away takes no issue. @NFL you are broken https://t.co/yjbQosyPNY Lol this is like Photoshopped or something right? https://t.co/oHf0QO7H6X @EricGraham03 yea, and now I'm pretty sure I could get open against them Rex is literally crippled by how bad his DB's are. He can't blitz at all Remember Bills MNF last year? We were talking about the EXACT SAME problems. These refs are universally clueless. The NFL is in trouble @NFL do you hate your sport? All that said, the Bills are not losing this game because of officiating. They are losing because they are a bad football team Richard Sherman is a garbage human being. Scum of the earth Who are the Bills drafting 6th overall next April? @salmaiorana woops Lmao "why are ratings down" https://t.co/uARSxlmV6e @nfl do u still not know why ratings r down or r u with us now What a shit league. Even the tv personalities can't believe it All I want for Christmas is an end to the NFL Richard Sherman takes an illegal shot at a kicker and we don't get to kick a field goal. This is a strong league @jackdigiac buy* I'm ashamed @johnhewitt_8 Anyone. Please god, literally anyone else. This guy is brutal I will by Stephon a plane ticket out of this city find me a damn cornerback How is this secondary this bad Stephon is BRUTAL Bills secondary getting absolutely abused @Molly_PC yea we're on our way to a swim meet Didn't dawn on me before but I really hope kiddos who aren't old enough to vote aren't ruining these results https://t.co/wW3vsPJO9L This mannequin challenge thing is cool and also what the hell Curiosity killed the cat I loathe myself !!!!!! https://t.co/IuxKZ4WmFQ How is this team so inconsistent https://t.co/qoNMRmI9vA *me blender https://t.co/xGBo8Qbz9T Blows my mind how the media can spread absolute fabrications and take zero responsibility for the reality it creates Daylight savings from Saturday to Sunday.

If the Sabres won the cup at home I think the city would sink into the lake Absolutely as good as it gets. Wow PLEASE go to 11 Rajai Davis has ICE IN HIS VEINS @Duke_University @samashleyyy deal @samashleyyy @Duke_University yea adam do mine, $10 and a firm handshake Would shut the country down https://t.co/EFaEbGoYU9 Literally writing an email to my professor asking for an extension on an assignment because it's raining four hours away This game has everything. If it was the last baseball game ever I think that would be ok I feel privileged to have witnessed this game @TrickyDick299 pin it Bron going BANANAS @ShaneCooke_ how can you not love this H O L Y C O W The Hendricks move. The next installment of the Cubs curse? Couldn't ask for a better ball game @JxredNHL now say Tyrod's not a real quarterback @J2theGrr don't tell me I missed one https://t.co/HhPZFz2d9F Game 7's make the world go round Kluber owned the Cubs last time... Johan Larsson is playing his way into the hearts of Sabres fans #ThingsINeverThoughtIWouldSay 2-3 times a day https://t.co/kmvim4UIJo People who bought Percy harvin jersey shirts on clearance look like geniuses right now @ShaRenczkowski4 https://t.co/z8ImJw7x12 Exactly how we all thought they would https://t.co/MGx7KWd8pV What if he's... actually... good... https://t.co/plWuZxtGo3 Page counts are suggestions goodnight @johnhewitt_8 Tom Brady is their best defensive player It's shaping up to be a cakewalk for Brady in the Superbowl and I don't know if I'm emotionally ready for that yet again The thought "wow this carpet really needs to be vacuumed" just entered my conscious self. So I guess that's it for me. New Bruno Mars is an instant classic @MirDiGiacomo u look like joe Can we, as a society, retire the word "ignorant?" It is the most over-used/ misused English word. It pretty much means nothing at this point @thatgingerkid23 one can only dream Teach yourself to stop focusing on what's wrong and start focusing on what's right @Duke_University likely @Duke_University what the hell where did you find that I was trying to make fun of the fact that I actually lost my wallet and am genuinely nauseous about it bc that's how I deal with my problems How is there no gif of Morty Seinfeld saying "my wallets gone" @thatgingerkid23 ho ho ho 🎅🎅 Was really trying hard to at least wait till tomorrow for this but HEY IT'S CHRISTMAS MERRY CHRISTMAS TWO WHOLE MONTHS OF CHRISTMAS WOW Maybe more and more NFL games will end in ties and eventually the league will just die. Wouldn't even be mad If it gets to 7 games the Cubs only win if they bring Steve Bartman to the mound and baptize him pregame @jackdigiac woulda been cool tho Aroldis parks one Wow this is so true lmao https://t.co/lzFrTBoyYF How cool would it be to be at Wrigley right now @samashleyyy sometimes both This is almost literally all of his screen time in that movie https://t.co/nVqszzbgya @AngeliaKowalski lol hills and valleys Drunk Bills fan to drunk Pats fan:

"You have transition lenses because you're a f*cking idiot" @AngeliaKowalski lmfao I love that a lot How can anyone actually afford World Series tickets @Duke_University sports could end after that. I'd be ok with it Been watching pimple popping videos for half an hour. The basement of the Internet Thought to myself "why is Twitter SO dead tonight?"

Soon realized that it's Halloween weekend.

Carry on. @solazzo77 @apush_review We are going all the way to the Hamptons Sam Reinhart and I would be best friends @kevinbuf heard it first is for sure If life continues on its current trajectory, it will be -14° and rainy (somehow) on Sunday and the Bills will lose by 42 The same man whose final four doesn't include any team below the #2 seed https://t.co/wCZs5jobVB This is a very good thing https://t.co/yx2gKrnDJs Unreasonably upset about Vine @ShaRenczkowski4 @J2theGrr you're not wrong @solazzo77 @apush_review @buffalobills NEED to be original "Oh guys, Jackson has tickets tonight.

How is he on tv @johnhewitt_8 which Matthews? @johnhewitt_8 they did rush 6, so I can understand that @johnhewitt_8 Regardless, he airmailed it.

Top 5 song of the millennium That's it, rain. You win. I concede and welcome my watery grave I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectfuuuuuuul The Sabres would win every game if the objective was to get as close to scoring as possible without actually putting the puck in the net DON'T DO IT TO HIM SAM GOD DAMN @amp913 to have Washington on your side *heart-melting harmony* Robin has absolutely no rebound control. It's really really really bad Wrote a paper about Hamilton today; have had "Washington On Your Side" stuck in my head all day. Not complaining ROR + Okposo = aesthetically pleasing hockey #1 on the list of things I miss is Ryan Miller and his ridiculous saves I like when Joe sarcastically likes my hockey tweets Damn Ennis is working hard I HATE this weather @EricGraham03 I think all it takes is to be loud and funny looking @MirDiGiacomo you thought https://t.co/utdhltL0Es @MikeTheOrc_ damn didn't hear about that Two people have been shot near Canisius this semester Alright I'm done This just in: only racist bigots can find any pleasure in history https://t.co/SOgyqQYZFz Respecting the hell out of Megyn Kelly right now @J2theGrr tru but I'm talkin bout these clowns on their analysis shows, not the candidates @J2theGrr where are they Can I make a living out of exposing media bias bc business would be BOOMING @Jsteszewski @ShaneCooke_ I like the attitude Watching the debate should absolutely be a valid excuse for my lack of completed homework @J2theGrr @ShaneCooke_ but what if I get bleach on my t-shirt @ShaneCooke_ you're not 35 @ShaneCooke_ @Jsteszewski unfortunately I agree with Shane.

I'll repeat, GENO SMITH is their answer to their INTERCEPTION problem @ShaneCooke_ what if you only enjoy mildly entertaining movies @Krauseyboy @ShaneCooke_ and shane looks like he belongs on the cover of Straight Outta Compton @Krauseyboy @ShaneCooke_ Krause looks like a Greek god @maggied1112 cute @Jsteszewski head first into the boards A team traded Ryan O'Reilly A hit like that is what the league is trying to eliminate right??? Marcus Foligno is a man on a MISSION this year. I LOVE it The forecheck is awesome tonight Half trying to graduate, half hoping something cool happens and I don't need to graduate @BillHoppeNHL how do they not even offer an explanation? Isn't it standard to explain why the ruling on the ice was changed? @realjuicyb its simple, rational thought processes such as that that are our undoing @realjuicyb At least the Sabres won't destroy us until like March. Plenty of time to heal up after the Bills winless November Am I wrong or is Hudson Fasching just a more talented version of Nic Deslauriers? Why sit Hudson for Nic??? Little late but, that Ennis pass 😍😍 @ShaneCooke_ @J2theGrr So you're projecting him as the greatest quarterback in the history of the sport. As long as you're realistic @ShaneCooke_ @J2theGrr just wait @ShaneCooke_ @J2theGrr RGIII had one hell of a rookie year too https://t.co/b72wLUCNOl @MirDiGiacomo tru Fitz out here MURDERING boys @jackdigiac 9 more points lol Idk how this is still a storyline but I'm just gonna clear the air: Vontaze Burfict is an absolute thug who probably shouldn't be in the NFL @johnhewitt_8 you're screwed Gruden is questioning whether the Jets should start Geno hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahHhHHHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah Bruh if David Johnson pulls this out for me 🙌🙌🙌 Think I might cry https://t.co/wgLdGcnMGs Tic-tac-toe https://t.co/7InZcG4ZQn Just Shazamed a random song I was feeling, it's a Chainsmokers song.

AM Jackson: I'll wear a hat Fun fact of the day: there are 11 Blockbuster locations still operating in the US Kaep can kneel all he wants. I'm happy knowing that he's a really, really shitty quarterback Taking the starting job away from Dak when he's 5-1 is almost too NFL for me to handle No matter what you say or what you do, when I'm alone I'd rather be with you More people cheered for Lesean jogging on the sideline than the field goal Tyrod just tore Leseans ACL Kaep is not a good quarterback Colin Kaepernick leaves the stadium wearing a full body cast https://t.co/e9nO4yjFX4 I live for these graphics https://t.co/g5qxEq18Xh Stupid but 100% sincere question: how can we know bees are endangered?

My argument is that it's experience in how not to run a country. @J2theGrr @realjuicyb Andrew Cuomo in the NY gubernatorial race @J2theGrr @realjuicyb Hillary Clinton @realjuicyb Right. I just hate the argument that political experience makes someone a better candidate. Often, literally the opposite is tru @realjuicyb unless ur a felon of course @realjuicyb the Constitution @realjuicyb what Everyone that was born here and is at least 35 years old is equally qualified to be president https://t.co/wNv2bWG6pU @ColesTwitt3r every time I watch your snap story I notice that my hand is as far away from my face as possible at the end That's a touchdown from every other legit quarterback in the league Someone teach stephon how to tackle pls @ShaneCooke_ @J2theGrr thats just not true @ShaneCooke_ @J2theGrr drive slow @johnhewitt_8 boi I'll be 80 years old talking about how much I hate him don't tell me how to live @johnhewitt_8 maybe he'll break a leg How nice of the NFL to give Brady a preseason game for his return Oh shiiiiiiiiiii Lin-Manuel is hosting SNL tonight and Twenty One Pilots is the musical guest BRUH @beeeeennnn_ that's the best one @apush_review Come on Norris.

Last week Kelvin had no catches, this week Deandre had one. I don't know how I can predict this stuff How is Kansas City this bad Mike Tomlin is the man. Best NFL coach not named Belichick Jump on the Raiders bandwagon now. They are next up Belichick is literally finding a way to use the fact that his only healthy QB is Julian Edelman to his advantage @ShaneCooke_ "as long as I don't crack my screen or something in the next two days I'll be fine" Today was the first time I've ever left a game before it ended and I feel dirty now Lol people acting like Sammy being on IR matters. They threw to him 4 times a game @MorlikTheDwarf thank you for your insight Here is Miranda making fun of me for doing work that she won't help with https://t.co/4ArzwHBNEv If you ever see me wearing a hat and I'm not at a sporting event, it means I rolled out of bed 4 minutes before I left the house @MorlikTheDwarf omg Scott I thought you'd never ask Veeeeeery frustrated @donz2210 @J2theGrr maybe @donz2210 thats more like it @MirDiGiacomo come on over @donz2210 eh that's not what I mean I wanna do something outside.

That was 30 minutes ago and now I think I'll just live here @ShaneCooke_ @Krauseyboy https://t.co/RMqwnDnfke Immediately upon exiting heavy traffic I speed. It's the release of my pent up traffic aggression and it's so satisfying "Her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining" Kelvin Benjamin has destroyed my fantasy football morale Where is Akon? @Duke_University pour one out Honestly the best part of the game today was the fact that there was very little doubt by the middle of the first quarter. We held control @MatthewColler gimme a Bills take for old times sake RIP José Fernandez. How horrifyingly sad Remember when Fitz performed surgery on the Bills D? I don't understand football Sat Jimmy Graham after I said to myself "I need to switch tight ends, Martellus is gonna do nothing." Guess who didn't sit Martellus @hsimon62 defense played at least 10 minutes in that quarter Defense is gassed Walt Powell is the GOAT What happened to this team lmfao @apush_review fyi Miranda is genuinely offended that my mom saw the baby before she did just throwing that out there. Be wary @BuffaloSabres oops Send them Ennis and your first rounder and go win a few cups ok @buffalos @BuffaloSabres GET HIM HIS TRADE PHONE https://t.co/tbQ6WVI7T1 For the first time probably since I was 2 or 3 I did not go on a single roller coaster this summer so that's bumming me out Kinda love Canisius, kinda wanna just be done with school forever @Zielinski_Nick definitely will do To any of my friends that enjoy stand up comedy: I very highly recommend anything by Bill Burr. The man is absolutely hilarious Had this cold for two days and I'm about ready to end it @johnhewitt_8 what's it like to have god on your side I am enthralled by NE this year. And I'm actually genuinely excited to watch Julian Edelman play quarterback @realjuicyb Well there also hasn't been a debate in months. Not to say it will be full of substance, but still, nothing to go off of @EricGraham03 I don't want to call him ruined yet. Definitely behind, but not ruined. He needs some confidence Ah the good ole days https://t.co/HPzhVQzICQ Wow Osweiler is not good Phil Simms just said Brock Osweiler went to Houston because of their system. Yea probably NE never has a lot of talent on defense but it never matters at all Lmfao what even is pass interference Not sure Houston has broken 5 minutes T.O.P. @J2theGrr had to sell some cars and erectile dysfunction medication You go to commercial, return so we can see that he's obviously challenging the play, and go back to commercial... I can already see the headlines: "Can Brissett push Brady for the starting job?" @jackdigiac and that could be entirely Greg Roman's fault, I don't know. Still maddening Jacoby Brissett has 3 quarters of NFL experience and he just did something we're BEGGING Tyrod to do @EricG0006 edelman will have 250 passing yards and they'll just give them the title @EmilyWartinger ❤❤ let's get dinner tomorrow Pop machines that don't take $5 bills are #1 most pointless thing on this earth I have no voice this is a living hell @samashleyyy yes and I think I disguised it pretty well so @samashleyyy lol no I opened your text and then had to quickly put my phone down to deal with it and apparently hit the call button Got a bloody nose immediately as I woke up I already love this day Kill it kill it with fire https://t.co/rUFQREYqqC Hockey hockey hockey

All the time. 😊 Today's mood: fortune cookie. https://t.co/fF3q4YyP3Z @EricG0006 You probably knew more after your first day of welcome week. #stillsalty @J2theGrr when did that happen? Our driveway is getting redone today. My dad jokes are too advanced for even my dad. https://t.co/j2m0eN32Jd @ShannonRaczka good luck it doesn't work loll I am Emma Watson. https://t.co/xq7Jbj1PDl @Purple4kb yup it was that lol @Purple4kb wait that on my street... Unless there's another one??? @jackdigiac I'm southern I say soda @karazbock Knox 110. If you're standing at the board, it's right next to the top left door. Its gross and tracked everywhere in the room After Fire drill interrupts class, “Well class I may go a bit fast for you today, because some fucker pulled the fire alarm” #college There is a big pile of actual literal feces in the back of this classroom… I swear to god that’s actually really what it is. What the fuck Like how am I supposed to pay for ANYTHING in school or make ends meet in my life if I don’t prioritize my job??? Literally makes me so mad hearing the “you are a student first. That should be 100% all you care about” speech… @jessicazaidel like Kristen did it with her too, but that's less surprising lol BENS MOM JUST TOOK OVER THE POKEMON GYM AT WEGMANS WHAT IS HAPPENING GO KIM GO @abbyjeannep one must find another one to math with. Then there are two maths. @BrinnyLex never went to my 8am, just dropped it instead ☺ we're off to a good start Just sat in the wrong class for 10 minutes bc THAT professor was late. So by the time I figured it out, I was late for my actual class… FML @shannonraczka lol my first class in there ran out of seats the 1st day, so I sat on the stairs with a couple of kids… it’s nuts yo @ShannonRaczka have fun in that gi-fucking-normous classroom for your 10am in K20 😂 @karazbock awesome. Already? Think I might drop a class just bc I can't afford the textbook 😅🔫 Guess who feels like absolute dog doo doo right before the semester starts!!! #itsme #ofcourseitsme @becstasy_ wait till classed start to say that lol @itsally19 @countrysayingss I literally only see things like that.

I wish I could be one of those people who thinks of good times when it comes to loss. Instead, I can't ever get past the pain and sadness. @MirDiGiacomo @jackdigiac it wasn't me, but I wish it was. I didn't know I needed to see this, but I did. I've been here before a few times. And I'm quite aware of dying 🎶 @darlynplease @jdgmntlgay @ERuthie21 @ShannonRaczka tbh I think we might be best friends. Like actually. Lololol @BrinnyLex https://t.co/kGsBUKORdY @EmilyWartinger @karazbock and not even like the good kinda fudge. Ugh. @EmilyWartinger @karazbock "oh and now you have no time to wait for shipping to find it cheaper anywhere else. Thanks!" @EmilyWartinger @karazbock yeah but we both know it's gonna be more like "oh yeah, heres the 6 books you need. Cheapest is $200" @tumblrthings @dogtextings this is my future @EmilyWartinger @AngeliaKowalski woah yeah for real though it's a great film @AngeliaKowalski The Fundamentals of Caring. Its literally every genre of movie in one and is amazing. And it's on Netflix @karazbock I haven't gotten a single email and there's nothing on my black board... Maybe they're giving me a semester off lol @beeeeennnn_ https://t.co/6RA6sVlglO @becstasy_ haha definitely!!! She was telling me how you did her eyebrows and they looked so good, she loved it and showed it off. Lmfao @becstasy_ she was talking about you and I thought it was really cute lol I was talking to Ben's little sister about the play today and she talked about "the really pretty girl who does her eyebrows really good" @ShannonRaczka that's definitely it. Tim Horton has possessed you too @ShannonRaczka Ouch. Hope you at least had a decent crew to pass the time with :/ @JeremyCatania #420 @ShannonRaczka 1- how are you still open??? 2- why are we literally the same worker?

Ex: There's too many grossies in the water, so we're left with thirsty sciencey bitches @jackdigiac water main break somewhere made it more possible for bacteria and other grossies to get in the water. No guarantee it did though @AngeliaKowalski oops this sums up 19 years of my life https://t.co/clYpf99xlH Let's talk about how everyone thinks I'm just so free. Free? Did you hear how my body's waging war on me?

Like you have for a while." Thank you kind sir. I call it exhaustion 😊🔫 @LindsayAdymy everything is so much worse at night. I have never felt more alone in my entire life... All my friends are either broken or broke or both 🎶 @LindsayAdymy but with my luck, I doubt Death would be so kind as to pay a visit. @LindsayAdymy it's exam week, how much do you REALLY expect me to value my life? Studying procrastination level: reading the textbook while driving on the thruway to class. @apush_review @socialstuds IM SO EXCITED FOR YOU!!! Omg I remember you fangirling over Mr. Klaff forEVER! This is so cool! You know who you are right now 😉 https://t.co/g38V04HmSa Saw someone's bio that said "I'm just a sad girl with a nice butt" and I'm really feeling that. Like same girl. You go with your sad ass. I got bit by an experimental rat today. Now I'm just waiting for my powers to set in. 😈 @Funnny_Piccs @doubledickdude @radiotyme @TMZ this was actually so funny 😂 @BrinnyLex just made a bomb dinner for the boys bc I'm the best work wife. I'm sure its not what you had in mind, but yanno 😊 I get bored with my hair and dye it so much, I'm not sure how I have any left. @apush_review I think you'd like this account https://t.co/idZdzT7ALe @ShaRenczkowski4 not that I can think. Isn't it nice to have that extra inch or two? Get a whole new view of the world. @ShaRenczkowski4 heels? What else is there? @SavageJihad @MyTownisBlue @EmilyWartinger @jackdigiac @AngeliaKowalski Frick yeah Flyers!!! I'm pumped @EmilyWartinger @jackdigiac it maxed it out at 6. So naturally I got that many. Lol @EmilyWartinger @jackdigiac pretty sure we've got Robin and her Rochester possy and @AngeliaKowalski with us too @EmilyWartinger @jackdigiac I actually got so anxious about it, I bought a whole bunch of tix the min they were available.

Lol @ShaRenczkowski4 no it is. Lol I deserved it though. @Lawnnnnn I'm pretty sure that's just how relationships work. Like is that not normal? Really glad @ShaRenczkowski4 for to see how productive I am at work. 😂😭😂 @ShaRenczkowski4 @beeeeennnn_ @jackdigiac zoo??? @ShaRenczkowski4 @beeeeennnn_ @jackdigiac yes please @LindsayAdymy @Iifepoems till 3 but it totally forgot it at home :( @LindsayAdymy 💜💜💜 dunno what your schedule's like, but if u get a chance to stop by tims today I have somethin for u https://t.co/qHggOxX5Wl And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don't mind. 🎶 No please dont, you fuel my paychecks. 😂 https://t.co/GswBYq87c8 @ShaRenczkowski4 are you sick?

But then it was cancelled and I was heartbroken. #redemption Yo @AngeliaKowalski @EmilyWartinger Ben doesn't wanna go to Springfest, so wanna keep company? 😀 I was actually crying at work when I found this out earlier. https://t.co/UtVi7QqC9M @ShannonRaczka nah, I didn't stir your tea so it evens out lol Yes. I am Molly. https://t.co/owndKaGc7z @LindsayAdymy @ERuthie21 yeah? Thought youd like that one 😂😭 @ERuthie21 I didn't know there existed a college without a bullshit psychology major... Wtf? @ERuthie21 I'm not kidding about my crisis. I chose my first college chasing love, why not do it again? https://t.co/yZybzL47e1 @ERuthie21 (((You're just feeding into my midlife crisis))) @ERuthie21 Gimme a Tims to tear shit up at and I'm fucking down. @ERuthie21 K. I like animals. @ERuthie21 Literally hanging by a thread to not switch to a Psych/Business major and not put this horrible stress on myself w/ Bio shit. @apush_review You're one of the few people who've ever told me that. I appreciate the reminder every now and again, I often forget. You too! @ShaRenczkowski4 @jackdigiac 💩💩💩 @apush_review I absolutely understand. The week after that is exams, then I'm free as a bird (that's totally a lie) and we can figure it out @jackdigiac My mistake. It's obv bc Thomas Matthew is hot af. @jackdigiac *defines me and Erin as so much attention* It's taking everything in me to not just get in my car and drive somewhere and start a new life somewhere else. Like it's just so tempting. @jackdigiac So for some reason I can never find this picture in my phone, no matter how many times I save it...So I always have to find this @apush_review So good to see you today, even if it was short lived and through the drive thru! Gotta catch up for real soon! Spent the first half of class trying to stay awake...now I feel awake but lost and having an anxiety attack about it. I'm better off asleep. I've been at work since 2pm and now I'm getting on an airplane... Planned trip or just that fed up? The world may never know. @ShaRenczkowski4 Damn that would be been cool @ShaRenczkowski4 stop are you going this week??? Ben and I will be there Wednesday! @caitlyn_papa13 @kelsey_cadwall @lordandtaylor lololololololol phil @ShannonRaczka aww yay!!! 💜 When you work full time, go to school full time, and try to have a social life too. https://t.co/cVcmU0Qz8v Someday, there will come a day when I do not even once have to fight the urge to sleep in the middle of the day. Today is not that day. I think I must've overslept or something... I thought we were still in January. I would love to know what it is that I did to make the universe so against me. I cannot catch a break. @jackdigiac not sure if I can't tell her facial expression bc she's indifferent, or.... @Molly_PC @alphathunderwav. This is that puppy!!!!!! @jackdigiac I particularly like the one where you're about to punch the shark through the cage. Lmao @jackdigiac Happy birthday 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤ https://t.co/gqtvnhH6k0 Actually me.

I hesitated even saying that, but hers was the most random one I could think of. Lol @ShaRenczkowski4 like Idk why, but I know that @AlysssaZbock would always drink an iced double double with caramel... They just stick. @ShaRenczkowski4 it's actually not that hard. Lol Well you see, I was GOING to go to that class, but then my dog jumped in bed with me and is too cute and cuddly to say no to. Too tired to be alive. For real. Ugh. This is friendship. Right here. https://t.co/fRt25XMJlK @alphathunderwav  https://t.co/xjQpWfRMgI It looks like one of those old iPod nanos. Lol https://t.co/ckbOGGd4cT Alas, I die. @Molly_PC this is literally what is giving me the strength to keep on rn.

And I wouldn't go into overtime. Then I work tomorrow morning. Tbh I'd be okay with raising $10 in the next 10 minutes to support the I'm A Broke College Student cause. https://t.co/V5sgg6D44D I AM SO EXCITED TO WORK FROM 10PM TODAY UNTIL 2PM TOMORROW. FRICK YEAH FLYERS LETS DO THIS.
(I'm dead inside) You're good for me, baby. Of that, I'm sure 🎶 @LindsayAdymy 💁 @apush_review nooo they definitely don't. God forbid they plow the lots, but don't worry, they made $17k in tickets today. Just sweet talked my way out of a parking ticket at UB. Go me 😉👍😏 “How to college”
 https://t.co/iLkJxlMbp8 Yes I do.
 https://t.co/eMSQyJl63I @EmilyWartinger couldn't even tell you where that is. Lol looks like I have to kill her! @EmilyWartinger if it was me, I didn't realize it. Haha where were you? @ShaRenczkowski4 yup How do you say "we need to talk" without saying we need to talk? @ my dumb professor who makes things harder than they need to be https://t.co/cwNERwrs3H @jackdigiac I tried, but then I got mad bc it seemed like I got a lot further than I actually was… To the professor that wants me to type an essay single-spaced 11pt font,
This is causing me physical pain to do. 
Sincerely,
I hate change. @WGRZ can you please tell me what is going on with Depew/Cheektowaga electricity? We're literally in the dark over here. #hahapuns @ShannonRaczka I mean it wasn't full, but still. 😂 we had a whole party with pizza and everything bc it was so dead. #imthebestsupervisor 💁 @ShannonRaczka yes!!! I actually made like a whole batch in a soup pot lol then put cheese on it and baked it in the oven 😍😍😍 @abbyjeannep I mean I get free stuff all the time so it's not that big of a deal. Lol just more the principle. @abbyjeannep I've worked at Tim's for almost 4 years...I won my first one today (I'm not allowed to keep it though bc unfair) @ShannonRaczka did you make chicken wing dip with Tim's materials??? I DID THE EXACT SAME THING #greatminds @NikiBrandel I literally come so close to telling him off every time I come in but Ben tells me not to. He's so uncomfortable to be around.. @NikiBrandel Ben has been telling me all night how sassy you've been to your creepy co-worker. On behalf of everyone, thank you. 😂 It doesn’t help that my professor has been saying “correlation does not equal causation” for the past 15 minutes. Omg. 😴😴😴 @jackdigiac really though… Soon I’ll be foaming at the mouthing twitching and be the talk of ub yik yak. @mtrench @starbucks It was playing because they didn’t know how to end it 😉 #seewhatididthere? #jkdontenditthatsmyfavorite I really think I may die if I don’t get caffeine in me soon… I’m dozing off in every class. This is brutal. Pro of working in a coffee shop:
-unlimited coffee while working

Con of working in a coffee shop:
-Caffeine withdrawal on days off @AngeliaKowalski right. Like I'm over here picking up nickels I find on the ground to buy a coffee. Second week of classes and I already missed two... And counting. I rock. #BellLetsTaIk is such a great thing. The stigma surrounding mental health illnesses needs to be addressed. Good work Canada. 💜 Nah nigga I'm doin it for me.  https://t.co/8zDxNj5g4T UB emails me twice every semester asking me to apply. But they send it to my UB email... I'm obviously already going here¿? @BrinnyLex I'm judging from out experience, it's &gt;23 @jackdigiac "Justin Timberlake (for the first time) Again" @jackdigiac but if you were him, you would never even know the possibility of not having been yourself, so you couldn't appreciate it fully. @karazbock haha I would, but I have no mix, no eggs, and less than no motivation to go out. Looks like we're gonna put it off again. Lol @karazbock ever since I saw your tweet about a warm brownie and ice cream, I have wanted it so bad. It's literally been days. 😂 @ERuthie21 "aww look at all the smog!" https://t.co/d9656JsoaS Well, looks like I'll be attending a lot of basketball games this year. Free tuition, here I come. https://t.co/4Nxexfa6xe That was supposed to be a good analogy, but maybe it sounds stupid. Idk. Doormats are the first thing you see anywhere, welcoming you, caring, being there. But people don't even think twice before stepping on it. Tbh it makes me sad to see other college students blossoming into beautiful people with beautiful lives, because I'm just kinda here @ShaRenczkowski4 aww sha you look super cute in your pic with that dashing young gentleman! 😍☺😊 @Applebees @LindsayAdymy I guess our decision is made! @LindsayAdymy alright sounds good, let's g! @LindsayAdymy AppleBees?

Most people (even old people) tell me they're still pretending too @DustinDros007 YES! And even though All Grown Up was supposed to be for older kids, it was never as good as the originals. @DustinDros007 Tbh I watched Rugrats in Paris not too long ago, and I do have to admit, it's actually a pretty solid movie. 😂 @alphathunderwav https://t.co/hv3v8lfjDy @ERuthie21 yeah, he's hittin it.  https://t.co/JiGMEG4b5c @ShaRenczkowski4 @alphathunderwav yoooo finna see us there ??? @alphathunderwav I JUST REALIZED WE ARE SEEING MT IN 6 DAYS I AM SO HAPPY FORGET THANKSGIVING I DONT EVEN CARE BC ASTORI-FUCKING-A . ☺🎶☺🎶☺ My grandma just sent me the eggplant emoji in reference to a penis....

Lol Ben wanted me to drive him to his class at 9am so I could go to the library. Jokes on him I took a nap in my car and just woke up. 😏😴😇 @jackdigiac better change your bio @ThoughtfulLyfe "everyone is happy being unhappy bc double think and there's cameras and they bang and get caught and brainwashed. The end"😊 @thenickcolletti #Kanye2020 And like he literally stopped 2 other cars to let them know the spot was mine and they couldn't take it. It was so nice. A guy at UB just walked up to my car and said, "hey I know parking is a bitch, and you look cute. Follow me back to my car take my spot" @ERuthie21 @teenagernotes actually it was just until I had my nightly seizure. 😂 @lukas_baumgart I mean if you scroll far enough then you start to see where he faved some celebrity boobs. So that's less lame I guess. Just out of curiosity, I just looked at the stuff Ben favorites, and it's pretty much all just Android stuff and Alex Morgan. He's lame. My dog is snoring and I've never felt such intense feelings of jealousy in my whole life. @ShaRenczkowski4 omg what the heck 😂 I did this in high school too. 😂 https://t.co/rOOT3XHfgn @ShaRenczkowski4 😒 @alwayssunny @meellisday @itsCharlieDay 😋🎃😊 @ShaRenczkowski4 do ittttttttttt.

You don't have teeth anymore, remember? 🎶All the drive in the world, but you still need gas... 🎶 My wisdom teeth are killing me, but it's going to cost me $1,300 to get them out. I am not ready for that kind of financial responsibility. @AngeliaKowalski "I don't have a car phone" @jackdigiac are you wearing a bump-it??? @LindsayAdymy @jackdigiac Also you get laid off every winter... @ZachPalgutt @alwayssunny @alphathunderwav why thank ya!!!

More from them: "my dad was telling me about how he has all of these connections that I could use but I'm like no dad idfwu" @jackdigiac my calc professor just wildly swings her eraser across the board without even looking.

I got through a whole week, I can skip class now right? @EmilyWartinger @AngeliaKowalski I'm parked in a faculty lot rn bc 30 minutes was long enough to call it quits.... @EmilyWartinger @AngeliaKowalski I mean we can't just say that we decided to carpool instead? @EmilyWartinger @AngeliaKowalski like I'm not even kidding, so you know what it takes to get one??? @EmilyWartinger @AngeliaKowalski are you as sick of trying to find parking as I am? I'm willing to lie and get a carpool pass if you are. The guy actually got mad at me while I was sitting in my car crying bc it was "outrageous" that I didn't know where he could get chopsticks More people approach me to ask stupid shit when I'm crying than any other time. "where's the dmv?" "Where can I buy chopsticks?" I don't even live my life for me. I live exclusively for everyone around me and it's still never enough. Once upon a time in a fairytale land, I was not to blame for everything bad happening in everyone's lives. @apush_review and everyone who has been taught by you is even more blessed. Hope you have a great year! @ShaRenczkowski4 no stop it ughhhhhh @ShaRenczkowski4 I GET OUT AT 2 OMG ME PLEASE I WILL CRY AND LOVE THEM AND DIE AND OMG PLZ Ben just farted LITERALLY ON MY FACE, then fanned it onto me more and doesn't understand why I'd be mad. @DJRanKan @shyguyshawn http://t.co/WLasH6OZzI @jackdigiac http://t.co/3WjLY6eeig @jackdigiac then we can start hanging out again. 😀 @jackdigiac can we stop being grownups who go to school and work and do homework and pay bills and ugh @jackdigiac *all the time in the world for two weeks until rehearsals for the next show you're in starts* Actually upset bc July 2nd was the last time I saw @jackdigiac 💔 @Professorlnk haha thanks! @alphathunderwav  https://t.co/HXvoNrUnla @alphathunderwav  https://t.co/lFKURAEKT8 @Molly_PC http://t.co/fGTZGny4Hw @Molly_PC http://t.co/V2kaCyGEfz @Molly_PC http://t.co/pRZDQOgOS8 I just googled "Ben meme" and this was the first thing.
