I don't think those cops suit up everyday and think  "I'm gonna kill a black guy" @Pschlarm if the cops were struggling to keep him down and they thought it's either us or him then while it may not be justified one can see @Pschlarm because regardless of his social life he could very well be a criminal. @Pschlarm that is really irritating because, a) one of the statements was false, obviously, and b) his children have nothing to do with this @Pschlarm I'm not going to disagree with you, that man shouldn't be dead. But when people say "unarmed black man" and "he was a father"... @Pschlarm well not to defend the killing, just remain open minded. @HistoryToLearn communist... so a buffoon... üòÇüòÇüòÇ https://t.co/MbtRApSbzB @Pschlarm eye witness accounts also said "hands up, don't shoot."

Only interference @Krauseyboy you're absolutely right but if you're gonna suspend a guy for hitting someone too hard, you have to put it in the rules @CodyBreedlove32 @Krauseyboy I wouldn't call it clean. It's 150% interference and he definitely should've sat for 2 @Krauseyboy so he got suspended because someone else broke up a pass. You suspend the hit, not the situation @Krauseyboy if the pass gets to him is it clean @Krauseyboy idk dude there's no way you convince me that should be a suspension. You can't suspend guys for being big and strong @Krauseyboy yea interference. Not a 3 game suspension The worst part is now he has a suspension history so you know they'll sit him down for 10 games next chance they get 1) No contact with the head

These LIGHT penalties are killing me "The Sabres lost the Winnipeg trade" The irony of Lindy coaching the Stars will never get old Love cringing at anthem singers @MirDiGiacomo @JayDeatts lmfao I think I remember what I was yelling at him about Swagger https://t.co/UZv28CLMCz Stacy's Mom is the only song I've never been sick of Still kind of amazed at the degree to which LeBron literally owns the entire city of Cleveland @EmilyWartinger he was NAMING AN EMPTY FOLDER @EricGraham03 duuuuuuude I can't stop smiling We are not worthy @ChrisNowak4 and make the nets bigger @ChrisNowak4 the league wants less goals I guess idk @Bulldogwgr following the trend set by the first two Your rules don't make sense @NHL Alternative inquiry: Why can't they kick it in? This is tiring @BuffaloSabres That's annoying because Eichel got molested a few minutes back. Can we call the rulebook once in a while @NHL He's the biggest hothead in the league, plays with a ton of passion. But let's in 2 WEAK goals Robin Lehner is the strangest goaltender Worst power play I have ever seen @Not_Mr_R you are a revolutionary, my friend Day 7,625: I still have not woken up as Justin Timberlake. This is beginning to distress.

Maybe next year @J2theGrr this might be funny if you used the name of someone actually on the sabres broadcast A couple errant passes and bouncing pucks have this team all out of sorts. Need to refocus Remember the 2-0 lead? Good times @EmilyWartinger changed our lives @MorlikTheDwarf I know where my priorities stand @becstasy_ your program ensures a body guard that gets in progressively worse shape and is less able to protect you. That said, I'll take it @becstasy_ what's the pay Very nervous to start classes again but mostly because I have done literally zero preparation My semester doesn't start till 1:00 I already feel behind @MorlikTheDwarf so I have to go out and  buy all the yogurt myself?

Or you can just spend $6 @nhl call the rulebook @Molly_PC honestly same I thought we could be the generation to drive that poison out of business @ShaneCooke_ in haven't even considered starting Eichel's behind the back breakout pass üòç So effortless.

I didn't go to this game This sport has changed so much. How do you watch a heart and soul player like Marcus take a cheap shot and do absolutely nothing about it? @samashleyyy I don't experience fear, I instill it @samashleyyy I laughed out loud on the metro @johnhewitt_8 welcome to the rest of society Omfg https://t.co/WD2nHkHxmZ @ShaneCooke_ they might not need to even try to tank Risto is the best forward on this team right now I see they've replaced the puck with an actual hot potato tonight Life goal: try them all https://t.co/Kf6J3vguTz The Sabres should hire Patrick Kaleta as their 4th line right winger and breathe some life into this heap https://t.co/66j5k830zm You can mute specific words or phrases on Twitter now.

I'm just asking why more hatred is the answer @realjuicyb @thatgingerkid23 I'm sorry that so many people think he's a real threat @realjuicyb I don't hate you, I don't know really anyone who does hate you, and I genuinely don't believe Donald Trump hates you @realjuicyb And I hope I don't appear to pretend to understand the lives of those who aren't. But I can assure anyone who is afraid @realjuicyb I guess the problem is that I never interpreted it that way. @realjuicyb I get what you're saying. I understand that people interpreted his campaign as one based on hatred. @realjuicyb I mean dude, we had this discussion last night. Clearly you don't understand what I'm saying. So what is the point "We are a nation divided"

Said by the very people driving the conflict and accusing half the nation of being racist To people spreading hate toward Trump and his supporters: what is your endgame? What do you hope to accomplish by digging this trench? @realjuicyb Crazy, I thought i just spent 15 minutes explaining why those flaws are misconceptions. In any case, goodnight @realjuicyb what part of my message here is me hiding from what he is? @realjuicyb Why do you think I don't feel responsible for my vote?

All that said, the Bills are not losing this game because of officiating. They are losing because they are a bad football team Richard Sherman is a garbage human being. Scum of the earth Who are the Bills drafting 6th overall next April? @salmaiorana woops Lmao "why are ratings down" https://t.co/uARSxlmV6e @nfl do u still not know why ratings r down or r u with us now What a shit league.

So I guess that's it for me. New Bruno Mars is an instant classic @MirDiGiacomo u look like joe Can we, as a society, retire the word "ignorant?" It is the most over-used/ misused English word.

We held control @MatthewColler gimme a Bills take for old times sake RIP Jos√© Fernandez. How horrifyingly sad Remember when Fitz performed surgery on the Bills D? I don't understand football Sat Jimmy Graham after I said to myself "I need to switch tight ends, Martellus is gonna do nothing." Guess who didn't sit Martellus @hsimon62 defense played at least 10 minutes in that quarter Defense is gassed Walt Powell is the GOAT What happened to this team lmfao @apush_review fyi Miranda is genuinely offended that my mom saw the baby before she did just throwing that out there.

And I'm actually genuinely excited to watch Julian Edelman play quarterback @realjuicyb Well there also hasn't been a debate in months. Not to say it will be full of substance, but still, nothing to go off of @EricGraham03 I don't want to call him ruined yet. Definitely behind, but not ruined. He needs some confidence Ah the good ole days https://t.co/HPzhVQzICQ Wow Osweiler is not good Phil Simms just said Brock Osweiler went to Houston because of their system. Yea probably NE never has a lot of talent on defense but it never matters at all Lmfao what even is pass interference Not sure Houston has broken 5 minutes T.O.P. @J2theGrr had to sell some cars and erectile dysfunction medication You go to commercial, return so we can see that he's obviously challenging the play, and go back to commercial... I can already see the headlines: "Can Brissett push Brady for the starting job?" @jackdigiac and that could be entirely Greg Roman's fault, I don't know. Still maddening Jacoby Brissett has 3 quarters of NFL experience and he just did something we're BEGGING Tyrod to do @EricG0006 edelman will have 250 passing yards and they'll just give them the title @EmilyWartinger ‚ù§‚ù§ let's get dinner tomorrow Pop machines that don't take $5 bills are #1 most pointless thing on this earth I have no voice this is a living hell @samashleyyy yes and I think I disguised it pretty well so @samashleyyy lol no I opened your text and then had to quickly put my phone down to deal with it and apparently hit the call button Got a bloody nose immediately as I woke up I already love this day Kill it kill it with fire https://t.co/rUFQREYqqC Hockey hockey hockey

Con of working in a coffee shop:
-Caffeine withdrawal on days off @AngeliaKowalski right. Like I'm over here picking up nickels I find on the ground to buy a coffee. Second week of classes and I already missed two... And counting.
