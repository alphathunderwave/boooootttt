You're white trash if you think French vanilla is a good coffee flavor
But this sort of issue is where governmental regulation intrudes too far in my eyes
Please, politicize shit that doesn't affect the discourse of my life like my right to own a gun cause I want one or how much I pay in taxes
Will be put into action...these are real people's lives though! I'm sick of politicizing the human experience
The US compared to other countries, but this just seems like the Republican Party is trying to assert the point that their values can &amp;...

Still can't believe the Titanic sunk smh
Earth school is forever
How to take care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually #RantOver
To be practical about it but patient/optimistic at the same time. Think about where I wanna get to/appreciate where I am &amp; I'm also learning
I am experiencing now (even though tough to adjust to), is humbling and I am learning to really think about what I want out of life...
So long story short, it's tough not to feel like a huge bum when your whole day's structure is ripped away, but this weird stagnant period..
I thought I learned a lot in college...pffffft I'm learning a lot even after I graduated...
The best feeling in the world was walking outta work yesterday and not bursting into flames cause of the heat #Blessed #FallWeather #Finally

Really wanna go to the Oktoberfest celebration in Buffalo Central Terminal and wear some lederhosen, drink some beer, and eat some schnitzel
Made baller money at work today and just realized my underwear were on inside out so I'm definitely thinking it was good luck...🍀 💭

@JaredStarzynski Whoa calm down twitter is public, you don't wanna get reported for saying racy things like that!
@JaredStarzynski 😂 sweet I'll read you a book next time I see you
@JaredStarzynski I heard you like girls with big...brains
@JaredStarzynski Can't I'm one glass of sangria deep and now reading a philosophy book
Also if Alt-J ever comes near Buffalo I'm getting my hands on some controlled substances and going to vibe
I think Alt-J and Soulja Boy are the only artists that could literally sing out numbers and I'd be like "yeah dis my shit"
@JaredStarzynski lmao
As a middle class white girl who's had a pretty easy life, I like the beastie boys a lot more than I should

Can't wait to go to sleep for five hours and have it feel like a second lmao I wasn't made to be a functioning member of society
Go to this table that's discussing their order like it's the fckin Yalta Conference and what do they get?...30 wings all mild 😒
@KimPuccia Lemme know what you think!

The universe will keep putting you in the same situation until you learn what you need to from it 💭
I know that Kavita and Emily are some of my best friends simply because of the fact that laugh out loud at most of our text convos lmao
Watching episodes of Keeping Up with the Kardashians where Kim is with Kris Humphries is so weird I don't think they even liked each other
Yesterday I was told by a Canadian that I'm Canadian cause I love bloody caesars and I was wearing flannel #RealLifeRobinScherbatsky

@Teedbag6 Lmfao what do you want me to do here in dirty Cheekto?!
Day 3 of not being in school when everyone else is: came up with a new format to organize my t-shirts in my t-shirt drawer #mundanelife
Alabama Shakes, Cage the Elephant, Black Keys, Dirty Heads...bands that always just help me get right
Probably just go for world domination
If I could learn how to crack my own back I feel like I'd be so on one that I can't even predict what I'd do next on that power trip
Finished the day off by going to the bar for a pitcher of margaritas. I guess this is adult life
Day 2 of not being in school when everyone else is: volunteered from 9-12, napped from 12-3, and now I'm going to play kickball lmaoooo 😭

I also really wanna go see sand dunes/hike in Death Valley...I'm all about the deserts/mountains
I wanna go to the burning man festival one of these days 🤔🌵🔥
Wish I was going to La Tomatina 😭🍅🇪🇸🍷
Whenever I type in "hot xtra saucy" for a wing order I feel like I'm sexting the cooks
@Teedbag6 Lmao I look hungover 😂😵

Mark my words...I am NOT going to sleep on it if Lana del Rey comes within a 3 hr radius of me ever again
It's all about who you wanna go to Wegman's with
Literally just thought about checking my email at midnight cause there "might be something new"...Just checked it @ 11...I think I'm high
Life is precious. Take care of yourself, be thankful for every day, and always do what your soul tells you 💕
@SuchanAndSuch Ty you get me
Probably cause it's mostly old white supremacists working there
Wegmans is superior to Tops on every facet of the supermarket scale...but I must say Tops has some next level potato salad
I spent $9 on one beer tonight. Be still my heart

@DereKaczorowski Ok so after the first few soapy flavored sips it was kinda good
Other than the fact that they get you toasted real quick

Whyyyyyyy do I have to think that Bobby from below deck is so cute he's such a douche bag
@emwartin U right
Should I have a mai tai after work or should I not go down that decrepit road?
If you use "regular" as an adjective to describe anything you are below average intelligence I don't care!!! 🗣🗣🗣
This Charlottesville shit is insane. It's not like "this country is fuckin whack" it's more like "the human race is whack"...idk man

Really just had bud lite and captain crunch for breakfast. Thought I graduated from college already 😬
I basically sold my youth waiting in hour and a half lines for the Superman at DL. Can't tell if this feeling is nostalgia or PTSD
So hyped to ride some roller coasters at Darien Lake tomorrow with my friends am I turning 21 or 12?

@jackdigiac Thanks Jackson. Did you mean the whole shred or my invitation for people to fuck me up lol
@MikeTheOrc_ Thanks friend 😊
Okay ppl you are officially invited to fuck me up and tear my opinion to shreds
I'm also a privileged white girl who is TWEETING about political issues but I think we definitely need to examine these things
Do I know how to solve moral issues with economically feasible solutions? No. But I think it's something to strive for
It's screwing over a lot of people and halting a lot of social progress
I feel like we keep making legislation that is all about economic practicality so we can keep or image as the best nation in the world but..
we are just constantly missing the mark about what's important in life
America is so brainwashed. Yes we're lucky to have the freedoms and rights that we do but...
Split, Croatia just sounds like such a badass place 😈
