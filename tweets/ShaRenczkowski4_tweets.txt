@jackdigiac We could have TB12 as our QB and the Bills would still find a way to mess it up
@jackdigiac I just don't see him staying healthy, so I don't mind this decision. I wouldn't have been mad if they picked up the option tho
@jackdigiac But if we did we would be paying him $12M even if he's not healthy in 2018. We can always resign him or attempt to
I believe I do wayyyy to much for people. But will I ever stop? Probably not

@cd151250 could have been. I just hope we get things changed and actually win some games this year
@cd151250 very true. But we would also need our line to protect them when they do throw the ball and our line sometimes forgets to play
@cd151250 I would take Cutler over Romo if it came down to it, but after the last few seasons I really don't want him
These headaches need to go 😖😭
@cd151250 goodness gracious no
Someone be amazing and bring me either Tims or ice cream
My car died in the school parking lot LOL
