@Pschlarm üòÇüòÇüòÇ K, thanks man
@Pschlarm I'm sorry if I offended you, I'm just stating my opinion
@Pschlarm I also at this time don't believe he should have been shot. But I think the cops need to protect themselves first and foremost
@Pschlarm but it proves that he is capable of some serious violence
@Pschlarm because the cops aren't sex offenders with criminal records
@Pschlarm the cops dilemma. I don't think those cops suit up everyday and think  "I'm gonna kill a black guy"
@Pschlarm if the cops were struggling to keep him down and they thought it's either us or him then while it may not be justified one can see
@Pschlarm because regardless of his social life he could very well be a criminal.
@Pschlarm that is really irritating because, a) one of the statements was false, obviously, and b) his children have nothing to do with this
@Pschlarm I'm not going to disagree with you, that man shouldn't be dead. But when people say "unarmed black man" and "he was a father"...
@Pschlarm well not to defend the killing, just remain open minded.
@HistoryToLearn communist... so a buffoon...
üòÇüòÇüòÇ https://t.co/MbtRApSbzB
