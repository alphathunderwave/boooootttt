All my friends are back in school and I'm so bored that I've started my school work early... need to go back asap
@vishavdubb I'm pretty sure Jill would say that's not a good enough reason @submarine_queen
@vishavdubb I just can't deliberately skip for no reason
For the Record: Jill made a deal with me that if I don't skip a single class this semester she'll jump into Lake LaSalle 😂😂
I'd rather have three minutes of wonderful than a whole life of nothing special

I'm never enough no matter how hard I try

It pains me to see how amazing some of these other schools' yearbooks are while knowing our school won't even fund the advisor for the club.
@MorlikTheDwarf Congratulations!

Can't sleep after getting so irritated 😐
And please, do not you use "all-encompassing" words like "everyone", "always", and "never".. These make your statements rarely true if ever.
Ignorance is not bliss.. Before you argue about something please understand what it is you are arguing about and look at it from both sides
Tweeting doesn't do "nothing" It can promote awareness, and is a tool that if used properly could make a difference.. Or the opposite..
Apparently real men cuddle together...? 👬👬👬👬
