@Tom_Anderson37 responds to himself ...smh
@nick1233210 I challenge u to a dog fight, u have 1 week to train Lou, our dogs shall fight to the death
@brie_allen there's at least 1 occasion everyday where he actually deserves a choke slam
@brie_allen https://t.co/iotacI8Hq1
@Tom_Anderson37 and yet no one responded
I choke slam my puppy on a daily basis
@annieniland I get that but it's frustrating when u c that they had no problem dumping money into Baegen Hall this summer
@annieniland and do u think if they would have mentioned that the ramp was gunna be closing the students would have put the money in that
@annieniland I think most commuters r just in the mindset of I pay almost 40k a year, I deserve a safe place to park
@annieniland when the college gives money to pointless projects rather than funding important ones......
@Duke_University @jack0696 Jesus Christ that was savage shit duke
@annieniland rather than fixing it
@annieniland if no one says anything to the school they r gunna think that 1 floor is enough and would prolly just tear down the ramp
@annieniland the thing is 1 floor of Peking is not adequate, u have commuters, teachers, and dormers with cars that all park there
@jack0696 @Duke_University why the fuck r u at school
@annieniland students r trying to voice their opinion so they choose to spend money on things that matter to them, not 100000 dollar statues
@annieniland they financially can't take on the project right now but they get more money every year and eventually decide what to do
@annieniland @jack0696 that's the most ridiculous argument I've ever heard, ur comparing bad food that every school has to the ramp
@calebkitcho my thing is like they could find like student volunteers or pay a student 10 bucks an hour to sit in the booth
@calebkitcho at 7:10 the ramp is halfway full, by 9:30 it's completely full
Tell me how the parking ramp is allready damn near full
Is it too early in the semester to start considering dropping out
@reesporter2003 I'm good
