Lots, sidewalks, roads, etc. @buy_2_hams @erika_dillender @michaelsana13 please impart your wisdom dear Ham Man. @erika_dillender @michaelsana13 The Ham man can explain it. @buy_2_hams @joey_biro @AliIngersoll4 @DessenaSam they probably only plowed around the dorms, so they can technically say they plowed. @UBuffalo @DNicholson33 @ub_alert why don't they just do them ALL, not just what makes them look bad on the news.

Okay but like he speaks like he’s on QVC trying to sell shitty gems. Wish he’d go back to that job and get outta my class. Fucking Gerald drives me nuts. 7 minutes in and he’s already annoying. Probably texting his psychiatrist son for answers to show off. 🙄 Walking outside at UB and a guy really just whips a light saber out of his bag and charges at another guy. It was intense. @jackdigiac @IRSnews they already did.

All my friends are either broken or broke or both 🎶 @LindsayAdymy but with my luck, I doubt Death would be so kind as to pay a visit. @LindsayAdymy it's exam week, how much do you REALLY expect me to value my life? Studying procrastination level: reading the textbook while driving on the thruway to class. @apush_review @socialstuds IM SO EXCITED FOR YOU!!! Omg I remember you fangirling over Mr. Klaff forEVER! This is so cool! You know who you are right now 😉 https://t.co/g38V04HmSa Saw someone's bio that said "I'm just a sad girl with a nice butt" and I'm really feeling that. Like same girl. You go with your sad ass. I got bit by an experimental rat today. Now I'm just waiting for my powers to set in. 😈 @Funnny_Piccs @doubledickdude @radiotyme @TMZ this was actually so funny 😂 @BrinnyLex just made a bomb dinner for the boys bc I'm the best work wife.

Lol @ShaRenczkowski4 no it is. Lol I deserved it though. @Lawnnnnn I'm pretty sure that's just how relationships work. Like is that not normal? Really glad @ShaRenczkowski4 for to see how productive I am at work. 😂😭😂 @ShaRenczkowski4 @beeeeennnn_ @jackdigiac zoo??? @ShaRenczkowski4 @beeeeennnn_ @jackdigiac yes please @LindsayAdymy @Iifepoems till 3 but it totally forgot it at home :( @LindsayAdymy 💜💜💜 dunno what your schedule's like, but if u get a chance to stop by tims today I have somethin for u https://t.co/qHggOxX5Wl And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don't mind. 🎶 No please dont, you fuel my paychecks. 😂 https://t.co/GswBYq87c8 @ShaRenczkowski4 are you sick?

Wtf? @ERuthie21 I'm not kidding about my crisis. I chose my first college chasing love, why not do it again? https://t.co/yZybzL47e1 @ERuthie21 (((You're just feeding into my midlife crisis))) @ERuthie21 Gimme a Tims to tear shit up at and I'm fucking down. @ERuthie21 K. I like animals. @ERuthie21 Literally hanging by a thread to not switch to a Psych/Business major and not put this horrible stress on myself w/ Bio shit. @apush_review You're one of the few people who've ever told me that. I appreciate the reminder every now and again, I often forget. You too! @ShaRenczkowski4 @jackdigiac 💩💩💩 @apush_review I absolutely understand. The week after that is exams, then I'm free as a bird (that's totally a lie) and we can figure it out @jackdigiac My mistake. It's obv bc Thomas Matthew is hot af. @jackdigiac *defines me and Erin as so much attention* It's taking everything in me to not just get in my car and drive somewhere and start a new life somewhere else. Like it's just so tempting. @jackdigiac So for some reason I can never find this picture in my phone, no matter how many times I save it...So I always have to find this @apush_review So good to see you today, even if it was short lived and through the drive thru! Gotta catch up for real soon! Spent the first half of class trying to stay awake...now I feel awake but lost and having an anxiety attack about it. I'm better off asleep. I've been at work since 2pm and now I'm getting on an airplane... Planned trip or just that fed up? The world may never know. @ShaRenczkowski4 Damn that would be been cool @ShaRenczkowski4 stop are you going this week??? Ben and I will be there Wednesday! @caitlyn_papa13 @kelsey_cadwall @lordandtaylor lololololololol phil @ShannonRaczka aww yay!!! 💜 When you work full time, go to school full time, and try to have a social life too. https://t.co/cVcmU0Qz8v Someday, there will come a day when I do not even once have to fight the urge to sleep in the middle of the day. Today is not that day. I think I must've overslept or something... I thought we were still in January. I would love to know what it is that I did to make the universe so against me. I cannot catch a break. @jackdigiac not sure if I can't tell her facial expression bc she's indifferent, or.... @Molly_PC @alphathunderwav. This is that puppy!!!!!! @jackdigiac I particularly like the one where you're about to punch the shark through the cage. Lmao @jackdigiac Happy birthday 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤ https://t.co/gqtvnhH6k0 Actually me.

Lol @ShaRenczkowski4 like Idk why, but I know that @AlysssaZbock would always drink an iced double double with caramel... They just stick. @ShaRenczkowski4 it's actually not that hard. Lol Well you see, I was GOING to go to that class, but then my dog jumped in bed with me and is too cute and cuddly to say no to. Too tired to be alive. For real. Ugh. This is friendship. Right here. https://t.co/fRt25XMJlK @alphathunderwav  https://t.co/xjQpWfRMgI It looks like one of those old iPod nanos.

Tbh I'd be okay with raising $10 in the next 10 minutes to support the I'm A Broke College Student cause. https://t.co/V5sgg6D44D I AM SO EXCITED TO WORK FROM 10PM TODAY UNTIL 2PM TOMORROW. FRICK YEAH FLYERS LETS DO THIS.
(I'm dead inside) You're good for me, baby. Of that, I'm sure 🎶 @LindsayAdymy 💁 @apush_review nooo they definitely don't. God forbid they plow the lots, but don't worry, they made $17k in tickets today. Just sweet talked my way out of a parking ticket at UB. Go me 😉👍😏 “How to college”
 https://t.co/iLkJxlMbp8 Yes I do.
 https://t.co/eMSQyJl63I @EmilyWartinger couldn't even tell you where that is. Lol looks like I have to kill her! @EmilyWartinger if it was me, I didn't realize it. Haha where were you? @ShaRenczkowski4 yup How do you say "we need to talk" without saying we need to talk? @ my dumb professor who makes things harder than they need to be https://t.co/cwNERwrs3H @jackdigiac I tried, but then I got mad bc it seemed like I got a lot further than I actually was… To the professor that wants me to type an essay single-spaced 11pt font,
This is causing me physical pain to do. 
Sincerely,
I hate change. @WGRZ can you please tell me what is going on with Depew/Cheektowaga electricity? We're literally in the dark over here. #hahapuns @ShannonRaczka I mean it wasn't full, but still. 😂 we had a whole party with pizza and everything bc it was so dead. #imthebestsupervisor 💁 @ShannonRaczka yes!!! I actually made like a whole batch in a soup pot lol then put cheese on it and baked it in the oven 😍😍😍 @abbyjeannep I mean I get free stuff all the time so it's not that big of a deal. Lol just more the principle. @abbyjeannep I've worked at Tim's for almost 4 years...I won my first one today (I'm not allowed to keep it though bc unfair) @ShannonRaczka did you make chicken wing dip with Tim's materials??? I DID THE EXACT SAME THING #greatminds @NikiBrandel I literally come so close to telling him off every time I come in but Ben tells me not to. He's so uncomfortable to be around.. @NikiBrandel Ben has been telling me all night how sassy you've been to your creepy co-worker. On behalf of everyone, thank you. 😂 It doesn’t help that my professor has been saying “correlation does not equal causation” for the past 15 minutes. Omg. 😴😴😴 @jackdigiac really though… Soon I’ll be foaming at the mouthing twitching and be the talk of ub yik yak. @mtrench @starbucks It was playing because they didn’t know how to end it 😉 #seewhatididthere? #jkdontenditthatsmyfavorite I really think I may die if I don’t get caffeine in me soon… I’m dozing off in every class. This is brutal. Pro of working in a coffee shop:
-unlimited coffee while working

Con of working in a coffee shop:
-Caffeine withdrawal on days off @AngeliaKowalski right. Like I'm over here picking up nickels I find on the ground to buy a coffee. Second week of classes and I already missed two... And counting. I rock. #BellLetsTaIk is such a great thing. The stigma surrounding mental health illnesses needs to be addressed. Good work Canada. 💜 Nah nigga I'm doin it for me.  https://t.co/8zDxNj5g4T UB emails me twice every semester asking me to apply. But they send it to my UB email... I'm obviously already going here¿? @BrinnyLex I'm judging from out experience, it's &gt;23 @jackdigiac "Justin Timberlake (for the first time) Again" @jackdigiac but if you were him, you would never even know the possibility of not having been yourself, so you couldn't appreciate it fully. @karazbock haha I would, but I have no mix, no eggs, and less than no motivation to go out. Looks like we're gonna put it off again. Lol @karazbock ever since I saw your tweet about a warm brownie and ice cream, I have wanted it so bad. It's literally been days. 😂 @ERuthie21 "aww look at all the smog!" https://t.co/d9656JsoaS Well, looks like I'll be attending a lot of basketball games this year. Free tuition, here I come. https://t.co/4Nxexfa6xe That was supposed to be a good analogy, but maybe it sounds stupid. Idk. Doormats are the first thing you see anywhere, welcoming you, caring, being there. But people don't even think twice before stepping on it. Tbh it makes me sad to see other college students blossoming into beautiful people with beautiful lives, because I'm just kinda here @ShaRenczkowski4 aww sha you look super cute in your pic with that dashing young gentleman! 😍☺😊 @Applebees @LindsayAdymy I guess our decision is made! @LindsayAdymy alright sounds good, let's g! @LindsayAdymy AppleBees? Or Al's Toon Town is always a safe bet lol I would give anything to not feel like this... @LindsayAdymy kk so where are we going for din din??? @LindsayAdymy maybe next week??

#AtLeastTheresFreeCoffee Me af https://t.co/n8ejF0Pw1g @MattKelkenberg well we all suffer from winter induced amnesia. At the first signs of snow and cold, WNY-ers forget this happens yearly. I've been punched in for 2 1/2 hours and have barely done any work at all. So now can I call in sick? @MattKelkenberg speaking on behalf of Buffalo, yes. Yes we are kidding.

Happy boxing day! I went back to my car and turned on the heater and curled up with a blanket. Been asleep for half an hour. I saw 3 girls walk to the door when I pulled up and they didn't come back, so they went in ??? How. I called cust service 4x already. Ok so Wegs is closed till 7, but I'm scheduled at 6, but the doors are all locked. I've been standing outside for a while. It's cold. Help. @DustinDros007 or maybe it's just bringing to light the madness that's always been inside of everyone. I've decided to stop caring what different days are so I'm not let down. Christmas?

Becoming overwhelmed with life, but what else is new? @jackdigiac at the rate you're going, I'm thinkin more like 20. @jackdigiac Have you ever been suggested to take blood pressure medication? You seem to have an adverse hypertension reaction to the NFL... @EmilyWartinger like I'm 90% sure it was at least one of them.

Most people (even old people) tell me they're still pretending too @DustinDros007 YES! And even though All Grown Up was supposed to be for older kids, it was never as good as the originals. @DustinDros007 Tbh I watched Rugrats in Paris not too long ago, and I do have to admit, it's actually a pretty solid movie. 😂 @alphathunderwav https://t.co/hv3v8lfjDy @ERuthie21 yeah, he's hittin it.  https://t.co/JiGMEG4b5c @ShaRenczkowski4 @alphathunderwav yoooo finna see us there ??? @alphathunderwav I JUST REALIZED WE ARE SEEING MT IN 6 DAYS I AM SO HAPPY FORGET THANKSGIVING I DONT EVEN CARE BC ASTORI-FUCKING-A . ☺🎶☺🎶☺ My grandma just sent me the eggplant emoji in reference to a penis....

I highly recommend it. Today I'm working from 6am pretty much straight through to 10pm. Then I work at 6am tomorrow and have class until 10pm. #WhatHaveIDone 💵💰💸 @ERuthie21 so glad you're listening to it 💜💜💜 Is "heavy hearted" an official personality trait already, or am I just starting that myself?

Lol Ben wanted me to drive him to his class at 9am so I could go to the library. Jokes on him I took a nap in my car and just woke up. 😏😴😇 @jackdigiac better change your bio @ThoughtfulLyfe "everyone is happy being unhappy bc double think and there's cameras and they bang and get caught and brainwashed. The end"😊 @thenickcolletti #Kanye2020 And like he literally stopped 2 other cars to let them know the spot was mine and they couldn't take it. It was so nice. A guy at UB just walked up to my car and said, "hey I know parking is a bitch, and you look cute. Follow me back to my car take my spot" @ERuthie21 @teenagernotes actually it was just until I had my nightly seizure. 😂 @lukas_baumgart I mean if you scroll far enough then you start to see where he faved some celebrity boobs. So that's less lame I guess. Just out of curiosity, I just looked at the stuff Ben favorites, and it's pretty much all just Android stuff and Alex Morgan. He's lame. My dog is snoring and I've never felt such intense feelings of jealousy in my whole life. @ShaRenczkowski4 omg what the heck 😂 I did this in high school too. 😂 https://t.co/rOOT3XHfgn @ShaRenczkowski4 😒 @alwayssunny @meellisday @itsCharlieDay 😋🎃😊 @ShaRenczkowski4 do ittttttttttt.

Year. @chanelpuke CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEARS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME DAY. 🎶 I don't know why I cry, but I think it's because I remembered for the first time since I hated you, that I used to love you 🎶 @TrickyDick299 @donz2210 @nick1233210 whichever one is better accessible. @TrickyDick299 just ask the little Asian guy you're always snapchatting with. @jackdigiac too much chewing involved. You don't have teeth anymore, remember? 🎶All the drive in the world, but you still need gas... 🎶 My wisdom teeth are killing me, but it's going to cost me $1,300 to get them out. I am not ready for that kind of financial responsibility. @AngeliaKowalski "I don't have a car phone" @jackdigiac are you wearing a bump-it??? @LindsayAdymy @jackdigiac Also you get laid off every winter... @ZachPalgutt @alwayssunny @alphathunderwav why thank ya!!!

More from them: "my dad was telling me about how he has all of these connections that I could use but I'm like no dad idfwu" @jackdigiac my calc professor just wildly swings her eraser across the board without even looking.

I got through a whole week, I can skip class now right? @EmilyWartinger @AngeliaKowalski I'm parked in a faculty lot rn bc 30 minutes was long enough to call it quits.... @EmilyWartinger @AngeliaKowalski I mean we can't just say that we decided to carpool instead? @EmilyWartinger @AngeliaKowalski like I'm not even kidding, so you know what it takes to get one??? @EmilyWartinger @AngeliaKowalski are you as sick of trying to find parking as I am? I'm willing to lie and get a carpool pass if you are. The guy actually got mad at me while I was sitting in my car crying bc it was "outrageous" that I didn't know where he could get chopsticks More people approach me to ask stupid shit when I'm crying than any other time. "where's the dmv?" "Where can I buy chopsticks?" I don't even live my life for me. I live exclusively for everyone around me and it's still never enough. Once upon a time in a fairytale land, I was not to blame for everything bad happening in everyone's lives. @apush_review and everyone who has been taught by you is even more blessed. Hope you have a great year! @ShaRenczkowski4 no stop it ughhhhhh @ShaRenczkowski4 I GET OUT AT 2 OMG ME PLEASE I WILL CRY AND LOVE THEM AND DIE AND OMG PLZ Ben just farted LITERALLY ON MY FACE, then fanned it onto me more and doesn't understand why I'd be mad. @DJRanKan @shyguyshawn http://t.co/WLasH6OZzI @jackdigiac http://t.co/3WjLY6eeig @jackdigiac then we can start hanging out again. 😀 @jackdigiac can we stop being grownups who go to school and work and do homework and pay bills and ugh @jackdigiac *all the time in the world for two weeks until rehearsals for the next show you're in starts* Actually upset bc July 2nd was the last time I saw @jackdigiac 💔 @Professorlnk haha thanks! @alphathunderwav  https://t.co/HXvoNrUnla @alphathunderwav  https://t.co/lFKURAEKT8 @Molly_PC http://t.co/fGTZGny4Hw @Molly_PC http://t.co/V2kaCyGEfz @Molly_PC http://t.co/pRZDQOgOS8 I just googled "Ben meme" and this was the first thing.
