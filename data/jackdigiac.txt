Bury them forever Praying that Toronto is like that Colorado team that had one good year and is now an abomination of the sport It literally looks like batting practice https://t.co/eMqHFNZ34p Still can't believe Wisconsin blew that game last night @Things4WhitePpl while wearing volleyball knee pads Yo Wisconsin how do you let that happen @EmilyWartinger @AngeliaKowalski she ain sleep My man missed the question mark https://t.co/aLB4ykXSjC Think less.

A lot of gray area Heh https://t.co/jS5tKOgdAk @CodyBreedlove32 @Krauseyboy dude got FLATTENED lol @Krauseyboy That's fair enough. My point is that he didn't break any rules with that hit. Only interference @Krauseyboy you're absolutely right but if you're gonna suspend a guy for hitting someone too hard, you have to put it in the rules @CodyBreedlove32 @Krauseyboy I wouldn't call it clean. It's 150% interference and he definitely should've sat for 2 @Krauseyboy so he got suspended because someone else broke up a pass. You suspend the hit, not the situation @Krauseyboy if the pass gets to him is it clean @Krauseyboy idk dude there's no way you convince me that should be a suspension. You can't suspend guys for being big and strong @Krauseyboy yea interference. Not a 3 game suspension The worst part is now he has a suspension history so you know they'll sit him down for 10 games next chance they get 1) No contact with the head
2) Never left his feet

Need to refocus Remember the 2-0 lead? Good times @EmilyWartinger changed our lives @MorlikTheDwarf I know where my priorities stand @becstasy_ your program ensures a body guard that gets in progressively worse shape and is less able to protect you. That said, I'll take it @becstasy_ what's the pay Very nervous to start classes again but mostly because I have done literally zero preparation My semester doesn't start till 1:00 I already feel behind @MorlikTheDwarf so I have to go out and  buy all the yogurt myself?

Or you can just spend $6 @nhl call the rulebook @Molly_PC honestly same I thought we could be the generation to drive that poison out of business @ShaneCooke_ in haven't even considered starting Eichel's behind the back breakout pass üòç So effortless.

I'm just asking why more hatred is the answer @realjuicyb @thatgingerkid23 I'm sorry that so many people think he's a real threat @realjuicyb I don't hate you, I don't know really anyone who does hate you, and I genuinely don't believe Donald Trump hates you @realjuicyb And I hope I don't appear to pretend to understand the lives of those who aren't. But I can assure anyone who is afraid @realjuicyb I guess the problem is that I never interpreted it that way. @realjuicyb I get what you're saying. I understand that people interpreted his campaign as one based on hatred. @realjuicyb I mean dude, we had this discussion last night. Clearly you don't understand what I'm saying. So what is the point "We are a nation divided"

Said by the very people driving the conflict and accusing half the nation of being racist To people spreading hate toward Trump and his supporters: what is your endgame? What do you hope to accomplish by digging this trench? @realjuicyb Crazy, I thought i just spent 15 minutes explaining why those flaws are misconceptions. In any case, goodnight @realjuicyb what part of my message here is me hiding from what he is? @realjuicyb Why do you think I don't feel responsible for my vote?

All that said, the Bills are not losing this game because of officiating. They are losing because they are a bad football team Richard Sherman is a garbage human being. Scum of the earth Who are the Bills drafting 6th overall next April? @salmaiorana woops Lmao "why are ratings down" https://t.co/uARSxlmV6e @nfl do u still not know why ratings r down or r u with us now What a shit league.

It's really really really bad Wrote a paper about Hamilton today; have had "Washington On Your Side" stuck in my head all day.

Plenty of time to heal up after the Bills winless November Am I wrong or is Hudson Fasching just a more talented version of Nic Deslauriers? Why sit Hudson for Nic??? Little late but, that Ennis pass üòçüòç @ShaneCooke_ @J2theGrr So you're projecting him as the greatest quarterback in the history of the sport.
